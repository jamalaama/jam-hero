2D Top Down RPG Game

In this project I am following a YouTube tutorial in order to program my own desktop Pok√©mon style game. 
Ill be using the following apps for this:
<ul>
<li>Tiled</li>
<li>Pixilart</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
</ul>

At first I'll be using pre made tile sets in order to render my characters/scenery, but I'll be designing my own for implementation on the side.
